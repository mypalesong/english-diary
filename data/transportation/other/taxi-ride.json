      "오늘 회의가 끝나고 너무 피곤해서 택시를 탔다.",
      "버스나 지하철을 타기엔 기력이 하나도 없었어.",
      "앱으로 호출하니까 3분 만에 도착해서 편했다.",
      "뒷좌석에 편하게 앉아서 가니까 정말 좋았어.",
      "그냥, 창밖 풍경을 보면서 멍하니 있었어.",
      "기사님이 길을 정말 잘 아셔서 빨리 도착했다.",
      "평소에는 30분 걸리는 길인데 20분 만에 도착했어.",
      "기사님이랑 잠깐 대화도 나눴는데 좋은 분이셨어.",
      "음악도 조용하게 나오고 차도 깨끗해서 쾌적했다.",
      "택시비는 좀 나갔지만 오늘은 그럴 만한 가치가 있었어.",
      "집에 도착하니까 정말 빨리 온 것 같아서 신기했다.",
      "현관문 앞까지 데려다주니까 짐 들고 가기도 편했어.",
      "가끔은 이렇게 편하게 가는 것도 필요한 것 같아.",
      "다음에 피곤할 때도 망설이지 말고 택시 타야겠다."

      "I was super tired after the meeting ended today, so I took a taxi.",
      "I had absolutely no energy to take the bus or subway.",
      "I called one with an app and it arrived in 3 minutes, which was convenient.",
      "It felt really nice to sit comfortably in the back seat.",
      "I just, like, spaced out watching the scenery outside the window.",
      "The driver knew the roads really well, so we arrived quickly.",
      "It usually takes 30 minutes, but we got there in 20.",
      "I chatted briefly with the driver and he was a nice guy.",
      "The music was playing softly and the car was clean, so it was pleasant.",
      "The taxi fare was a bit much, but today it was worth it.",
      "When I got home it felt like I got there so fast, it was amazing.",
      "Actually, being dropped off right at my front door made it easy to carry my stuff.",
      "I think sometimes traveling comfortably like this is necessary.",
      "Next time I'm exhausted, I should just take a taxi without hesitation."
