      "오늘 시내에 볼 일 있어서 차 끌고 갔는데, 주차가 진짜 헬이었어.",
      "처음에는 주차장 몇 군데 들어가 봤는데, 다 만차라는 거야.",
      "그래서 길거리에 주차할 데 찾으려고 30분 넘게 빙빙 돌았어.",
      "계속 같은 길만 도는 것 같아서 진짜 짜증 났어, 솔직히.",
      "다른 차들도 다 주차 자리 찾고 있어서, 완전 주차 전쟁 같았어.",
      "겨우겨우 한 곳을 찾긴 했는데, 자리가 너무 좁은 거야.",
      "양쪽에 차들이 이미 주차되어 있어서 들어가기가 진짜 힘들더라고.",
      "몇 번을 앞뒤로 움직이면서 조심조심 주차했어.",
      "주차하고 나서 내리려고 하는데, 옆 차랑 간격이 너무 좁았어.",
      "문을 조심스럽게 열어야 옆 차 긁지 않을 것 같아서 진짜 조심했어.",
      "거의 몸을 비틀어서 나와야 할 정도로 좁았어.",
      "나중에 차 끌고 나올 생각하니까 벌써 스트레스받더라고."

      "So today I had some errands to run downtown and I drove there, but parking was literally hell.",
      "At first I tried going into a few parking lots, but they were all full.",
      "So I drove around for over 30 minutes looking for a street parking spot.",
      "I felt like I was just circling the same streets and honestly I was so annoyed.",
      "Other cars were all looking for spots too, so it was like a total parking war.",
      "I finally found one spot but it was way too tight.",
      "There were already cars parked on both sides so getting in was really hard.",
      "I moved back and forth several times and carefully parked.",
      "After I parked I tried to get out, but the space between my car and the next one was so narrow.",
      "I had to open the door really carefully so I wouldn't scratch the car next to me.",
      "It was so tight I basically had to twist my body to get out.",
      "Just thinking about having to get the car out later was already stressing me out."
