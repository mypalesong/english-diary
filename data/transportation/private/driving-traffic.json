      "오늘 퇴근하고 운전해서 집에 가는데, 도로가 갑자기 막히기 시작했어.",
      "처음에는 그냥 좀 밀리나 보다 했는데, 점점 더 느려지더라고.",
      "한참 앞을 보니까 경찰차랑 구급차가 보이는 거야, 사고가 난 것 같았어.",
      "완전히 도로가 막혀서, 거의 한 시간 동안 조금도 움직이지 못했어, 진짜.",
      "옆 차선 차들도 다 멈춰 있고, 다들 답답해하는 게 느껴지더라고.",
      "나는 그냥 라디오를 틀어서 음악 들으면서 시간을 때우기로 했어.",
      "좋아하는 노래 나올 때는 혼자 신나게 따라 부르기도 했어, 솔직히.",
      "차 안에 혼자니까 부끄러울 것도 없잖아, 그래서 마음껏 불렀어.",
      "조금씩 앞으로 가긴 했는데, 정말 거북이 속도였어.",
      "사고 현장 지나가는데 차들이 엄청 많이 부딪혔더라고, 심각해 보였어.",
      "거기 지나가고 나니까 도로가 좀 뚫려서 정상 속도로 갈 수 있었어.",
      "집에 도착하니까 평소보다 두 배나 걸렸는데, 진짜 피곤했어."

      "So today after work I was driving home and the road suddenly started getting backed up.",
      "At first I was like, oh it's just a bit congested, but it kept getting slower and slower.",
      "When I looked way ahead I could see police cars and an ambulance, so I guess there was an accident.",
      "The road was completely blocked and I honestly didn't move at all for like an hour.",
      "Cars in the other lanes were all stopped too, and you could feel everyone was frustrated.",
      "I just decided to turn on the radio and listen to music to kill time.",
      "When my favorite songs came on I was singing along pretty enthusiastically by myself, honestly.",
      "I was alone in the car so there's nothing to be embarrassed about, so I sang as much as I wanted.",
      "We did move forward little by little, but it was really at a snail's pace.",
      "When I passed the accident scene there were so many cars that had crashed, it looked pretty serious.",
      "After I got past there the road opened up and I could drive at normal speed.",
      "When I got home it took twice as long as usual, and I was really tired."
