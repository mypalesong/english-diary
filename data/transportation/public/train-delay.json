      "오늘 전철 타고 가는데, 갑자기 전철이 덜컹 멈춰버린 거야.",
      "처음에는 뭔 일인가 싶어서 두리번거렸는데, 안내 방송이 나오더라고.",
      "신호 대기로 잠시 멈춘다고 하는데, 막 불안해지기 시작했어.",
      "약속 시간이 있어서 지금 늦으면 안 되는 상황이었거든.",
      "그런데 5분이 지나고, 10분이 지나도 전철이 안 움직이는 거야.",
      "역과 역 사이 중간에 멈춰 있으니까 내릴 수도 없고 진짜 답답했어.",
      "차 안에 있던 사람들도 다 짜증이 난 것 같더라고.",
      "누군가 한숨 쉬고, 누군가 핸드폰으로 전화하고, 분위기가 완전 안 좋았어.",
      "나도 친구한테 급하게 연락해서 늦을 것 같다고 말했어.",
      "결국 15분쯤 지나서야 전철이 다시 움직이기 시작했어.",
      "다음 역 도착했을 때는 이미 약속 시간 10분 지나 있었어.",
      "전철 지연 때문에 하루 스케줄이 완전 꼬여버린 기분이었어."

      "So today I was riding the train and suddenly the train just stopped with a jolt.",
      "At first I was like, what's going on, and I looked around, then an announcement came on.",
      "It said we were stopping briefly for signal wait, and I started getting anxious.",
      "I had an appointment and I couldn't be late at this point.",
      "But 5 minutes passed, 10 minutes passed, and the train still wasn't moving.",
      "We were stopped in the middle between stations so I couldn't even get off and it was really frustrating.",
      "It seemed like everyone in the car was annoyed too.",
      "Someone was sighing, someone was calling on their phone, the atmosphere was totally bad.",
      "I also quickly contacted my friend and told them I'd probably be late.",
      "Eventually after about 15 minutes the train started moving again.",
      "When we arrived at the next station I was already 10 minutes late for my appointment.",
      "It felt like the train delay completely messed up my whole schedule for the day."
