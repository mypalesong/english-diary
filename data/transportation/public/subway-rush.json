      "오늘 아침에 출근하는데, 지하철 타는 순간부터 진짜 지옥이었어.",
      "플랫폼에 사람들이 막 몰려있는 거야, 완전 인파의 바다.",
      "지하철 문이 열리자마자 사람들이 막 밀고 들어가는데, 나도 같이 떠밀려 들어갔어.",
      "안에 들어가니까 숨쉬기도 힘들 정도로 빽빽하더라고, 진짜.",
      "옆 사람이랑 어깨가 막 닿는데, 움직일 공간이 하나도 없었어.",
      "핸드폰을 꺼내려고 했는데, 팔도 못 움직이겠더라고.",
      "그냥 가만히 서서 버티는 수밖에 없었어, 솔직히.",
      "정거장 지날 때마다 사람들이 타고 내리면서 더 밀려서, 진짜 짜증 났어.",
      "한 30분 정도 그렇게 서 있었는데, 다리도 아프고 완전 피곤했어.",
      "내릴 역 가까워졌을 때 출구 쪽으로 가려고 하는데, 사람들 뚫고 가기가 진짜 힘들더라고.",
      "겨우겨우 내려서 밖으로 나왔는데, 숨 쉴 수 있어서 너무 좋았어.",
      "이럴 때마다 재택근무가 진짜 그리워진다니까, 완전."

      "So like, this morning when I was commuting to work, the moment I got on the subway it was literally hell.",
      "People were just crowded all over the platform, like a total sea of people, you know?",
      "As soon as the subway doors opened people were pushing and shoving their way in, and I got pushed in with them too.",
      "Once I got inside it was so packed that it was honestly hard to even breathe.",
      "My shoulder was like touching the person next to me, and there was literally no space to move.",
      "I tried to take out my phone but I couldn't even move my arms, honestly.",
      "I just had to stand still and endure it, you know what I mean?",
      "Every time we passed a station people were getting on and off and pushing more, and I was so annoyed.",
      "I stood like that for about 30 minutes, and my legs hurt and I was completely tired.",
      "When my stop got close I tried to move toward the exit, but pushing through the people was really hard.",
      "I barely managed to get off and came outside, and it felt so good to be able to breathe.",
      "Times like this really make me miss working from home, honestly."
