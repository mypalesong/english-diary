      "오늘은 날씨가 너무 좋아서, 뭔가 버스 타고 가는 것도 괜찮을 것 같았어.",
      "정류장에서 버스 기다리는데, 사람들이 생각보다 별로 없더라고.",
      "평소엔 항상 붐비는데, 오늘은 운이 좋았나 봐.",
      "버스가 왔을 때 바로 탈 수 있어서 기분이 좋았어.",
      "올라가자마자 창가 자리가 비어있는 게 보여서, 당연히 거기 앉았지.",
      "자리 잡고 앉으니까 진짜 편했어, 솔직히.",
      "버스가 출발하면서 창밖 풍경을 보기 시작했는데, 햇빛이 딱 좋았어.",
      "나무들이 막 지나가고, 사람들도 걸어 다니고, 뭔가 평화로운 느낌?",
      "이어폰 끼고 음악 들으면서 가니까 시간이 진짜 금방 갔어.",
      "다른 승객들도 다들 조용히 자기 할 일 하고 있어서 분위기가 편했어.",
      "목적지 가까워져서 내릴 준비하는데, 좀 아쉽더라고.",
      "가끔은 이렇게 여유롭게 버스 타고 가는 것도 나쁘지 않은 것 같아."

      "So like, the weather was really nice today, and I was thinking maybe taking the bus would be pretty nice, you know?",
      "I was waiting at the stop and honestly, there weren't that many people around.",
      "Usually it's super crowded, but I guess I got lucky today.",
      "When the bus came I could actually get on right away, which felt good.",
      "As soon as I got on, I saw this window seat was open, so obviously I took it.",
      "Once I sat down it was literally so comfortable, honestly.",
      "The bus started moving and I began watching the scenery outside, and like, the sunlight was just perfect.",
      "Trees were passing by, people were walking around, it kinda had this peaceful vibe, you know?",
      "I put in my earbuds and listened to music while riding, and honestly time flew by so fast.",
      "The other passengers were all quietly doing their own thing too, so the atmosphere was pretty chill.",
      "When we got close to my stop I started getting ready to get off, and I was actually kinda sad about it.",
      "Sometimes taking the bus leisurely like this isn't bad at all, I mean it."
