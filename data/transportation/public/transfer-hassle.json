      "오늘 친구랑 약속이 있었는데, 장소가 진짜 멀더라고.",
      "지도 앱으로 검색해보니까 세 번이나 환승해야 한다는 거야.",
      "처음에는 그냥 가자 했는데, 막상 가보니까 진짜 힘들었어.",
      "첫 번째 환승할 때 계단이 엄청 길어서 올라가는데 숨이 차더라고.",
      "겨우 올라갔는데, 또 플랫폼까지 걸어가야 해서 다리가 아팠어.",
      "두 번째 환승은 더 심했어, 솔직히.",
      "역이 진짜 큰데다가 환승 통로가 막 미로처럼 복잡한 거야.",
      "사람들도 엄청 많아서 헤매면서 가는데 진짜 짜증 났어.",
      "세 번째 환승까지 하고 나니까 다리가 완전 후들거렸어.",
      "목적지 역에 도착했을 때는 벌써 진이 다 빠져 있었어.",
      "친구 만나서 밥 먹기 전에 이미 피곤해진 기분이었어.",
      "다음엔 그냥 돈 좀 쓰더라도 택시 탈까 진지하게 고민 중이야."

      "So today I had plans with a friend, and the place was really far.",
      "I checked the map app and it said I had to transfer three times.",
      "At first I was like, whatever let's just go, but when I actually went it was honestly so hard.",
      "At the first transfer the stairs were super long and I was out of breath climbing up.",
      "I barely made it up and then I had to walk to the platform too, so my legs hurt.",
      "The second transfer was even worse, honestly.",
      "The station was really big and the transfer passage was like a complicated maze.",
      "There were so many people too and I was wandering around and getting really annoyed.",
      "After making the third transfer my legs were literally shaking.",
      "When I arrived at the destination station I was already completely drained.",
      "Before even meeting my friend and eating I was already feeling exhausted.",
      "Next time I'm seriously considering just spending some money and taking a taxi."
