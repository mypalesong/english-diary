      "So I've got this really important thing coming up next week and honestly, I've been super anxious about it.",
      "Like, I can't stop thinking about it and worrying whether I'll be able to do well.",
      "Every time I try to relax or think about something else, my mind just goes right back to it.",
      "I keep asking myself questions like, what if I mess up? What if it doesn't go well?",
      "All these 'what if' scenarios keep playing in my head over and over again.",
      "The worst part is it's affecting my sleep - like, I'll be lying in bed and my brain just won't shut off.",
      "I'm tossing and turning all night thinking about all the things that could go wrong.",
      "During the day, I'm having trouble concentrating on anything because these anxious thoughts keep popping up.",
      "I'll be trying to work or watch something, and suddenly I'm thinking about next week again.",
      "It's honestly pretty exhausting being this worried all the time, you know?",
      "I'm really trying to think more positively and tell myself it'll be fine.",
      "But it's easier said than done - like, I know I should relax, but my brain isn't cooperating."
