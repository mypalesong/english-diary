      "So I heard this news today that one of my really close friends is moving abroad.",
      "Like, we've been friends for years and hang out all the time, so it was kinda shocking to hear.",
      "When she told me, I was honestly really happy for her because it's this amazing opportunity she's been dreaming about.",
      "I mean, she's gonna start this whole new chapter in her life and I totally support that.",
      "But at the same time, I felt this like heavy feeling in my chest, you know?",
      "Because I realized we're not gonna be able to just meet up casually anymore like we do now.",
      "Like, no more random coffee dates or last-minute plans to grab dinner together.",
      "I know we can still video call and text, but honestly, it's not the same thing.",
      "I tried to act all positive and excited for her when we talked about it.",
      "But inside I was feeling pretty sad and a bit sorry for myself, I guess.",
      "It's this weird mix of emotions where I'm genuinely happy but also kinda heartbroken.",
      "Today was one of those days that's both happy and sad at the exact same time."
