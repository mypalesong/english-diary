      "So I was sitting at my table eating dinner by myself tonight, and out of nowhere this wave of loneliness just hit me.",
      "Like, I eat alone pretty often and it's usually totally fine, you know?",
      "But tonight for some reason, I just felt really lonely all of a sudden.",
      "There wasn't even a specific reason for it - I mean, nothing bad happened or anything.",
      "I just looked around my empty apartment and felt kinda sad and isolated.",
      "The silence felt really heavy, and I was just sitting there feeling sorry for myself.",
      "I tried watching something on my phone while eating, but it didn't really help.",
      "Eventually I was like, you know what, I need to talk to someone right now.",
      "So I picked up my phone and called one of my friends, hoping they'd answer.",
      "Thankfully they picked up and we just chatted about random stuff for like 20 minutes.",
      "Honestly, just hearing another person's voice and having a normal conversation made me feel so much better.",
      "By the time we hung up, that lonely feeling had pretty much gone away and I felt okay again."
