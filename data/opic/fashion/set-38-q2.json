      "얼마 전에 친구 결혼식 때문에 정장을 샀어요.",
      "평소에는 정장 입을 일이 없어서 한 벌도 없었거든요.",
      "명동에 있는 백화점 가서 여러 브랜드를 둘러봤어요.",
      "처음에는 그냥 검은색 정장 사려고 했는데.",
      "직원분이 네이비가 더 잘 어울린다고 추천해주시더라고요.",
      "입어보니까 확실히 네이비가 더 나아 보였어요.",
      "셔츠랑 넥타이도 같이 골라주셔서 편했고요.",
      "가격은 좀 비쌌지만 품질이 좋아 보여서 샀어요.",
      "결혼식 날 입고 갔는데 다들 잘 어울린다고 하더라고요.",
      "사진도 잘 나왔고 기분이 좋았어요.",
      "이제 면접이나 공식 행사 때도 입을 수 있어서 괜찮은 투자였던 것 같아요.",
      "정장 하나쯤은 있어야겠다는 생각이 들었어요."

      "So not long ago, I actually bought a suit because I had to go to a friend's wedding, you know.",
      "I literally didn't have a single suit in my closet because, like, I normally never have occasions to wear one.",
      "I went to this department store in Myeongdong and, you know, looked around at several different brands.",
      "At first, I was basically just gonna buy a plain black suit, like a standard one.",
      "But the staff member kind of recommended navy instead, saying it would honestly suit me better.",
      "When I actually tried it on, navy definitely looked way better on me.",
      "They also helped me pick out a shirt and tie to match, which was super convenient.",
      "The price was a bit expensive, I'm not gonna lie, but the quality looked really good so I just went ahead and bought it.",
      "I wore it to the wedding and, like, everyone kept saying it looked really good on me.",
      "The photos came out pretty well too, and I honestly felt great about it.",
      "I think it was actually a pretty good investment because now I can wear it to, like, job interviews or official events and stuff.",
      "It kind of made me realize that I should probably have at least one decent suit in my wardrobe, you know."
