      "약속 장소에 도착했는데, 친구가 조금만 기다리라고 하더라고.",
      "문 열고 들어가는 순간, 불이 확 켜지면서 사람들이 우르르 나타났어.",
      "생일 축하한다고 다 같이 소리 지르는데, 진짜 깜짝 놀랐어.",
      "친구들이 케이크랑 선물까지 준비해 놔서 눈물 날 뻔했어.",
      "몰래 준비하느라 얼마나 고생했을까 싶어서 너무 고마웠어.",
      "케이크에 초 끄면서 소원 빌었는데, 이런 친구들 계속 만나길 바랐어.",
      "같이 밥 먹고 술 마시면서 정말 행복한 시간 보냈어.",
      "선물 뜯어보니 내가 갖고 싶어 했던 거라 놀랐어, 내 말 다 기억하고 있었어.",
      "그날 밤에 집에 오면서 정말 감사하다는 생각이 들었어, 평생 잊지 못할 거야."

      "So I was honestly really touched and emotional when my friends secretly prepared a surprise birthday party for me.",
      "That particular day started out just like any other day - I went to the office and was working as usual, nothing seemed special at all.",
      "Then in the afternoon, one of my close friends texted me asking if I wanted to grab dinner together, and I thought it was just a regular casual dinner plan.",
      "When I arrived at the meeting place, which was actually someone's apartment, my friend told me to wait just a moment before going in.",
      "The instant I opened the door and stepped inside, all the lights suddenly came on and a whole group of people appeared from different corners.",
      "Everyone shouted \"Happy Birthday!\" together in perfect unison, and I was so shocked I literally froze in place.",
      "My friends had prepared this beautiful cake and individually wrapped presents, and I honestly almost started crying right there.",
      "I felt so incredibly grateful thinking about how hard they must have worked planning and preparing everything in secret.",
      "While blowing out the candles on the cake with everyone gathered around, I made a wish to keep having amazing friends like these in my life forever.",
      "We all sat down together and ate delicious food and drank, and honestly had such a wonderfully happy time celebrating.",
      "When I finally opened all the presents, I was genuinely surprised because they were exactly what I had mentioned wanting - they had remembered every little thing I said.",
      "On my way home later that night, I kept feeling waves of gratitude washing over me.",
      "This surprise party reminded me how lucky I am to have such thoughtful and caring friends.",
      "I know I'll honestly never forget that special night for as long as I live, you know?"
