      "부모님이 자랑스럽다고 말씀해주신 것도 정말 감동적이었고요.",
      "특히 엄마가 우시면서 축하해주시는 걸 보고 저도 울컥했어요.",
      "그리고 그날은 과거를 돌아보고 미래를 생각하게 만드는 날이었어요.",

      "So there are honestly several important reasons why that particular day felt so special to me.",
      "First of all, it marked the end of a long four years of hard work, but it was also the beginning of an entirely new chapter in my life.",
      "It was basically a major turning point - transitioning from being a carefree college student to becoming a responsible member of society.",
      "I remember feeling so many different emotions all at once throughout that entire day.",
      "Pride, regret, excitement, anticipation, anxiety - honestly all of these feelings were completely mixed together inside me.",
      "Spending time together at school with my closest friends for what we knew was the last time also carried such deep meaning.",
      "Because we all understood that we would each be going our separate ways from that point forward, every moment felt even more precious.",
      "It was also incredibly touching when my parents came up to me and said they were genuinely proud of me.",
      "Especially when I saw my mom actually crying tears of joy while congratulating me, I also completely got choked up.",
      "That day really made me stop and look back at everything from my past while simultaneously thinking seriously about my future.",
      "I spent a lot of time reflecting on what I had actually learned during my college years and how I wanted to live my life going forward.",
      "There had definitely been some really tough and challenging moments along the way, but they all somehow became cherished memories.",
      "The intense emotions I experienced that day are still incredibly vivid and clear in my mind even now.",
      "I think it was the combination of all those various meanings and emotions overlapping that truly made it such an unforgettable special day for me."
