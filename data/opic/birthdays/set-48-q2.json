      "아, 20살 생일이 제일 기억에 남아요.",
      "그때가 성인이 되는 첫 생일이었잖아요.",
      "친구들이 깜짝 파티를 준비해줬거든요.",
      "저녁에 PC방 간다고 해서 따라갔는데요,",
      "실제로는 친구 집에서 파티를 준비해놓은 거예요.",
      "문 열고 들어가니까 친구들이 다 모여있고, 케이크랑 음식도 있고 그랬어요.",
      "정말 감동받아서 눈물이 날 뻔했어요.",
      "그날 밤새도록 놀고 떠들고 정말 재밌었거든요.",
      "친구들이 돈 모아서 선물도 준비해줬는데, 제가 갖고 싶어 하던 시계였어요.",
      "그 시계를 지금도 가끔 차고 다녀요.",
      "그때 찍은 사진들도 아직 간직하고 있고요.",
      "생각해보면 그 친구들이 몇 주 전부터 계획한 거더라고요.",
      "나중에 들으니까 다들 비밀 유지하느라 힘들었대요.",
      "그래서 더 고맙고 의미 있는 생일이었던 것 같아요.",
      "그 생일 이후로 그렇게 특별한 생일은 없었던 것 같아요."

      "Oh, my 20th birthday is most memorable.",
      "That was the first birthday of becoming an adult.",
      "My friends prepared a surprise party for me.",
      "They said we were going to a PC bang in the evening, so I followed,",
      "but actually they had prepared a party at a friend's house.",
      "When I opened the door and went in, all my friends were gathered, and there was cake and food.",
      "I was really touched and almost cried, you know.",
      "That night we played and talked all night, it was really fun.",
      "Friends pooled money and prepared a gift too, and it was a watch I wanted.",
      "I still sometimes wear that watch.",
      "I still keep the photos we took then too.",
      "When I think about it, those friends had been planning it for weeks before.",
      "I heard later that everyone had a hard time keeping it secret.",
      "So I think that's why it was an even more grateful and meaningful birthday.",
      "I honestly don't think I've had such a special birthday since that birthday."
