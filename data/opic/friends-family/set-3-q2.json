      "이번 달에 부모님 댁에 다녀왔어, 한 달 만이더라고.",
      "엄마가 미리 연락해서 좋아하는 음식 뭐 먹고 싶냐고 물어보셨어.",
      "나는 엄마 손맛이 그리워서 된장찌개랑 불고기 만들어 달라고 했어.",
      "집에 도착하니까 벌써 음식 냄새가 나는 거 있지, 배고파졌어.",
      "엄마는 내가 살 빠졌다고 하시고, 아빠는 운동 열심히 하냐고 물어보셨어.",
      "식탁에 앉으니까 반찬이 정말 푸짐하게 차려져 있었어.",
      "엄마 요리는 항상 맛있는데, 집밥이 이렇게 그리웠나 싶더라.",
      "밥 먹으면서 요즘 어떻게 지내는지, 회사 일은 괜찮은지 물어보셨어.",
      "부모님이랑 얘기하다 보니 어느새 시간이 훌쩍 지나갔어.",
      "식사 후에 같이 TV 보면서 과일도 먹고 편하게 있었어.",
      "집에 가려고 일어서니까 엄마가 반찬 싸주시겠다고 하시더라고.",
      "짐이 무거웠지만 뿌듯한 마음으로 집에 돌아왔어, 다음 주말에 또 와야지.",
      "이런 시간들이 얼마나 소중한지 새삼 느꼈어.",
      "다음 주말엔 꼭 또 가야겠다고 마음먹었어."

      "So I actually visited my parents' place this month, and honestly, it had been like a whole month since I last saw them.",
      "Before I went, mom called me ahead of time and asked what kind of food I wanted to eat, you know?",
      "I told her I really missed her home cooking, so I asked if she could make doenjang jjigae and bulgogi for me.",
      "When I finally arrived at their house, I could already smell the amazing food cooking, which made me super hungry right away.",
      "Mom immediately said I looked like I had lost weight, and then dad asked if I was exercising regularly these days.",
      "When I sat down at the dining table, there were honestly so many delicious side dishes laid out everywhere.",
      "Mom's cooking is always incredible, and I suddenly realized just how much I had been missing real home-cooked meals.",
      "While we were eating together, they kept asking me how I've been doing lately and whether work was going okay.",
      "We talked about so many things - my job, my friends, my plans for the future.",
      "Time was honestly flying by so fast while I was talking with my parents, and I didn't even notice.",
      "After we finished the meal, we all sat together and watched TV, ate some fresh fruit, and just relaxed.",
      "When I finally got up to head home, mom immediately said she wanted to pack some side dishes for me to take.",
      "The bag ended up being pretty heavy with all the food, but I came home with such a full and happy heart.",
      "I'm definitely going to make sure I visit them again next weekend because these moments are so precious to me."
