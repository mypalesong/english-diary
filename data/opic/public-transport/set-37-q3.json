      "So when I compare it to when I was young, public transportation has honestly gotten so much better in every way.",
      "Like, in the past, you literally couldn't know exactly when the bus would arrive at your stop.",
      "You'd just stand there waiting endlessly at the bus stop, hoping it would show up soon.",
      "But now you can easily check the real-time location and arrival time on your smartphone apps, which is super convenient.",
      "The subway system has also been continuously expanding with new lines being added all the time.",
      "New lines like the Shinbundang Line and Sillim Line keep being created to serve more areas of the city.",
      "The transfer experience between different lines has become so much more convenient too.",
      "The underground transfer corridors are now well-connected and clearly marked, so it saves passengers a ton of time.",
      "Facilities designed for people with mobility challenges have also improved dramatically.",
      "Most subway stations now have elevators and wheelchair lifts installed to ensure accessibility for everyone.",
      "There are way more low-floor buses operating now too, so it's become much easier for people to get around with strollers or wheelchairs.",
      "I'm actually really looking forward to seeing what the future holds because they say autonomous self-driving buses will be introduced soon.",
      "The whole public transportation system has become incredibly efficient and user-friendly.",
      "It's honestly one of the things I really appreciate about living in a modern city, you know?"
