      "현대 아반떼인데 2019년식이에요.",
      "사실 처음에는 차가 꼭 필요하진 않았거든요.",
      "서울에서는 대중교통이 워낙 잘 돼 있으니까.",
      "근데 주말에 드라이브 다니고 싶어서 결국 샀어요.",
      "색깔은 화이트펄이고 디자인이 깔끔해서 마음에 들어요.",
      "연비도 괜찮은 편이라 유지비가 크게 부담되진 않고요.",
      "주중에는 거의 안 타고 주말에만 운전하는 편이에요.",
      "주차비 때문에 평일엔 그냥 지하철 타거든요.",
      "내비게이션이랑 후방카메라는 있는데 최신 기능은 없어요.",
      "그래도 제 첫 차라서 애정이 가요.",
      "요즘 전기차도 관심 있는데 아직은 비싸더라고요."

      "Yes, I actually bought a used car last year, which was pretty exciting for me.",
      "It's a Hyundai Avante, the 2019 model, and honestly it's been serving me really well.",
      "To be honest, I didn't really think I needed a car at first, you know?",
      "I mean, in Seoul, the public transportation system is so well-developed and convenient.",
      "Like, you can literally get anywhere using the subway or buses without any problems.",
      "But eventually I decided to buy it anyway because I really wanted to go for nice drives on weekends.",
      "The color is white pearl and I really like it because the overall design looks clean and modern.",
      "The fuel efficiency is actually pretty good too, so the maintenance cost isn't too burdensome for me.",
      "During the week, I hardly ever drive it - I basically only use it on weekends.",
      "Because of the parking fees downtown, I just take the subway on weekdays instead.",
      "It has navigation and a rear camera built in, but honestly it doesn't have the latest fancy features.",
      "Still, it's my very first car, so I'm genuinely attached to it despite its limitations.",
      "These days I'm getting interested in electric cars, but they're still way too expensive for my budget.",
      "Maybe in a few years I'll consider upgrading, but for now I'm totally happy with my Avante."
