      "So I honestly think that overall awareness about stress management has changed dramatically in society as a whole.",
      "Like, before in traditional culture, enduring and silently bearing stress was actually considered a virtue and sign of strength.",
      "But these days, there's been this widespread awareness that you should actively manage and relieve your stress instead of just suppressing it.",
      "Interest in the critical importance of mental health and wellbeing has also increased significantly across all age groups.",
      "Receiving professional psychological counseling now seems to be much more naturally accepted in society without the stigma.",
      "Even companies and workplaces have started paying serious attention to their employees' stress levels and mental health management.",
      "Many progressive companies now provide healing programs, meditation sessions, or professional counseling services as employee benefits.",
      "Also, stress-reducing activities like meditation, mindfulness, and yoga have been gaining massive popularity recently.",
      "There are literally tons of stress management apps that have come out in the past few years.",
      "These apps include helpful features like guided breathing exercises, sleep tracking and management, and meditation timers.",
      "But honestly, on the other hand, the stress factors themselves seem to have actually increased even more in modern life.",
      "Work pressure, social media comparison, economic uncertainty - there are just so many sources of stress nowadays.",
      "So I genuinely think that learning proper stress management techniques has become more important than ever before.",
      "We need to prioritize our mental health just as much as our physical health, you know?"
