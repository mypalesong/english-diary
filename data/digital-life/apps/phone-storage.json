      "So I kept getting these super annoying notifications saying my phone storage is almost full.",
      "Like, every single day it would pop up and I'd just swipe it away, you know?",
      "But today it got to the point where I literally couldn't even take new photos anymore.",
      "I was like, okay, I really need to deal with this now because this is ridiculous.",
      "So I started going through all my photos and videos to see what I could delete.",
      "Honestly, I had so many random screenshots and blurry photos that I don't even need.",
      "I deleted a bunch of stuff and then went through my apps to see which ones I never use.",
      "Found like 10 apps that I haven't opened in months, so I just deleted all of them.",
      "But even after all that, my phone was still pretty full, which was frustrating.",
      "So I ended up having to back everything up to the cloud, which took forever.",
      "Now I'm seriously thinking about maybe getting a new phone with way more storage.",
      "Like, maybe I should just get the version with the most storage next time, even if it costs more."
