      "So my friend was telling me about this app she's been using and honestly, she wouldn't stop raving about it.",
      "She was like, 'You have to download it, it's so good,' so I was like, okay fine, I'll try it.",
      "I went to the app store and downloaded it, and right away there was like a tutorial thing.",
      "But you know what, I kinda just skipped through it because I usually just figure things out as I go.",
      "When I started actually using it, I realized it's way more complicated than I thought.",
      "There are literally so many features and buttons everywhere, it's kinda overwhelming.",
      "I spent like 30 minutes just clicking around trying to understand what everything does.",
      "Some of it makes sense, but honestly, some of the features I have no idea what they're even for.",
      "I think I'm gonna have to take my time and try them out slowly, one by one.",
      "Like, maybe I'll explore one new feature each day or something.",
      "If it turns out to be actually useful, I'll definitely keep using it for sure.",
      "But if it's just complicated for no reason and doesn't really help me, I'm totally gonna delete it."
