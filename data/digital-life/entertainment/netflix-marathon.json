      "So I literally spent my entire weekend binge-watching this Netflix series, like non-stop.",
      "I started on Friday night thinking I'd just watch one or two episodes, you know?",
      "But after finishing each episode, I was like, okay just one more.",
      "The cliffhangers at the end of every episode were insane, so I honestly couldn't stop.",
      "I was watching it while eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner - basically all my meals.",
      "I even watched it lying down in bed, on the couch, everywhere.",
      "My eyes were getting tired but I just kept going because I had to know what happens next.",
      "By Sunday night I had finished the entire season, all like 10 episodes.",
      "When it was finally over, I felt this weird mix of emotions, you know what I mean?",
      "Like, part of me felt empty because there's no more episodes to watch.",
      "But at the same time, I felt kinda satisfied and accomplished that I finished the whole thing.",
      "Now I gotta wait forever for the next season to come out, which is honestly torture."
