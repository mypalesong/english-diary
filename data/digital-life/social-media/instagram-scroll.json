      "So I opened Instagram thinking I'd just take a quick look for like two minutes, you know?",
      "But then I started scrolling through my feed and literally couldn't stop.",
      "One post led to another, and before I knew it, over an hour had passed.",
      "Like, how does that even happen? Time just disappears when you're on Instagram.",
      "I was seeing all these people posting about their perfect lives and fun experiences.",
      "Everyone's traveling to cool places, eating at fancy restaurants, looking amazing in their photos.",
      "Honestly, it made me feel kinda envious watching everyone else's highlight reels, you know what I mean?",
      "Like, my life feels so boring compared to what I'm seeing on my feed.",
      "But at the same time, I know it's all just the best moments people choose to share.",
      "Still, it puts me in this weird complicated mood where I'm happy for them but also comparing myself.",
      "When I finally checked the time and realized how long I'd been scrolling, I felt super guilty.",
      "I was like, wow, I literally just wasted an entire hour doing nothing productive, and I put my phone down feeling kinda crappy about it."
