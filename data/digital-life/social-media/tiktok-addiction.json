      "So I opened TikTok just to watch like one or two videos, and suddenly two hours had vanished.",
      "Like, I literally don't even know where the time went - it felt like maybe 20 minutes.",
      "The thing about TikTok is the videos are so short, right? Like 15 seconds to a minute each.",
      "So you're always like, 'Okay, just one more,' and then you keep swiping up for the next one.",
      "Before you know it, you've watched like hundreds of videos without even realizing it.",
      "The algorithm is insanely good at showing you exactly what you wanna see, which makes it even more addictive.",
      "I'm not even exaggerating when I say it's one of the most addictive apps I've ever used.",
      "Every time I try to close it, something interesting pops up and I'm sucked back in.",
      "It's honestly getting to the point where it's affecting my productivity and sleep schedule.",
      "Like, I'll be lying in bed watching TikTok way past midnight when I should be sleeping.",
      "I'm genuinely starting to think I should just delete the app completely.",
      "But at the same time, I'm like, can I really live without it? It's such a tough decision, honestly."
