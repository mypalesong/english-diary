      "이번 달 전기세 고지서를 보고 깜짝 놀랐다.",
      "에어컨을 많이 틀어서 그런지 요금이 두 배로 나왔어.",
      "수도세와 가스비까지 합치니까 부담스러웠다.",
      "다음 달엔 좀 더 절약해야겠다.",
      "이번 달 전기세가 평소의 딱 두 배였어.",
      "폭염 때문에 에어컨을 거의 쉬지 않고 틀어서 그런 것 같아.",
      "너무 더워서 밤낮으로 에어컨을 켜 놨는데 전기가 엄청 많이 나가는 거지.",
      "그때는 뭐 시원하게 지내야지 나중에 생각하면 되지 이랬어.",
      "근데 그 나중이 지금이고 지금 대가를 치르는데 별로 안 좋아.",
      "전기세만 그런 게 아니라 수도세랑 가스비도 내야 해.",
      "세 가지 공과금을 다 더하니까 진짜 부담스러운 금액이었어.",
      "다음 달엔 진짜 절약해야겠어, 더워도 에어컨을 24시간 틀진 말아야지."

      "So I opened my electricity bill today and my jaw literally dropped when I saw the amount.",
      "Like, I had to look at it twice because I thought maybe there was some mistake or something.",
      "But nope, it was correct - this month's electric bill was literally double what it normally is.",
      "I'm pretty sure it's because I've been running the air conditioner like nonstop during this heat wave.",
      "It's been so hot lately that I just had the AC on all day and night, which obviously uses tons of electricity.",
      "At the time I was like, whatever, I need to stay cool, I'll deal with the bill later.",
      "Well, later is now, and I'm dealing with it, and it's not fun.",
      "And that's just the electricity - I still have to pay the water bill and gas bill on top of that.",
      "When I added up all three utility bills together, the total was honestly pretty burdensome.",
      "Like, that's a significant chunk of money that I have to pay just for basic utilities.",
      "This is definitely a wake-up call for me to be more conscious about my energy usage.",
      "Next month I really need to try to conserve more and not just blast the AC 24/7, even if it's hot."
