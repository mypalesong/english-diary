      "So I opened my credit card statement today and literally let out this huge sigh.",
      "The total amount at the bottom was way higher than I expected it to be.",
      "Like, I knew I'd been using my card a lot this month, but I didn't think it would be this much.",
      "The worst part is, I can't even remember what half of these charges are for.",
      "I'm scrolling through the list trying to figure out where all my money went.",
      "There's like random online purchases, food delivery, coffee shops - it all adds up so fast.",
      "I think a lot of it was just impulse buying, you know, buying stuff I didn't really need.",
      "Like, I'd see something online and just click buy without thinking about it.",
      "Or I'd grab stuff at the store just because it looked nice, not because I actually needed it.",
      "This is honestly a wake-up call - I really need to get my spending under control.",
      "I think next month I should try to use cash more instead of just swiping my card everywhere.",
      "That way I'll be more aware of how much I'm actually spending, since I'll physically see the money leaving my wallet."
