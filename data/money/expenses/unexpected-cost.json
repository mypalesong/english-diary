      "그러고 나서 수리비 견적을 줬는데 생각보다 훨씬 비쌌어.",
      "예산에 전혀 없던 지출이라 진짜 당황스러웠어.",
      "이번 달 돈을 어디에 쓸지 다 계획해 놨는데 이건 계획에 없었거든.",
      "근데 선택의 여지가 없었어, 일 때문에 노트북이 필요해서 고쳐야 했어.",
      "다행히 이런 상황을 대비해서 비상금을 모아 뒀어.",

      "So my laptop suddenly stopped working today, like completely out of nowhere.",
      "I was in the middle of something important when the screen just went black and it wouldn't turn back on.",
      "I tried everything - restarting it, checking the charger, holding down different buttons - nothing worked.",
      "So I had no choice but to take it to a repair shop to get it looked at.",
      "The technician told me there was some internal hardware issue that needed to be fixed.",
      "And then he gave me the estimate for the repair cost, which was honestly way higher than I expected.",
      "This was totally an expense I didn't have in my budget at all, and I was pretty flustered about it.",
      "Like, I'd already planned out where all my money was going this month, and this wasn't part of it.",
      "I didn't really have a choice though - I need my laptop for work, so I had to get it fixed.",
      "Thankfully I have an emergency fund saved up for situations exactly like this.",
      "I had to dip into that emergency money to cover the repair cost, which kinda sucks.",
      "But this whole situation really made me realize how important it is to have that safety net for unexpected expenses."
