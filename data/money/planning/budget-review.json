      "정확히 어디에 얼마를 썼는지 보니까 진짜 반성하게 됐어.",
      "그때는 괜찮았던 작은 것들이 다 합쳐지니까 많더라고.",
      "카페, 충동적인 온라인 쇼핑, 요리할 수 있었는데 배달 시킨 것들.",
      "생각보다 훨씬 낭비가 많았어.",
      "문제는 지출을 추적하거나 예산을 따르지 않았다는 거야.",
      "그냥 하고 싶을 때 돈 쓰고 큰 그림은 생각 안 했어.",
      "다음 달부터는 진짜 예산을 세우고 지켜야겠어.",
      "지출을 더 의도적이고 계획적으로 해야지."

      "So today I sat down and went through all my spending records from this month.",
      "I pulled up my bank statements and credit card bills to see exactly where my money went.",
      "Honestly, I was kinda dreading this because I knew it probably wasn't gonna be pretty.",
      "And yeah, when I started looking at all the charges, I definitely started feeling some regret.",
      "Like, seeing exactly where and how much I spent really made me reflect on my choices.",
      "There were so many purchases that, looking back now, were totally unnecessary.",
      "Little things here and there that seemed fine at the time but really add up.",
      "Coffee shops, impulse online shopping, food delivery when I could've cooked - it's a lot.",
      "Way more wasteful spending than I realized I was doing.",
      "I think the problem is I haven't been tracking my expenses or following any kind of budget.",
      "I just spend money whenever I feel like it without really thinking about the bigger picture.",
      "Starting next month, I need to actually create a budget and stick to it - be way more intentional and planned about my spending."
