      "요즘 투자한 주식과 펀드 수익률을 확인해봤다.",
      "일부는 올랐고 일부는 내려가서 복잡한 심경이야.",
      "단기적인 변동에 너무 신경 쓰지 않기로 했어.",
      "장기적으로 봤을 때 좋은 결과가 있길 바란다.",
      "어떤 건 샀을 때보다 내려가서 좀 실망스러웠어.",
      "기분 좋으면서도 걱정되는 이상한 조합인 거야.",
      "떨어진 것들을 더 내려가기 전에 팔고 싶은 마음도 들어.",
      "근데 단기 시장 변동에 패닉하지 말라는 조언이 기억나.",
      "그래서 이런 일일, 주간 변동에 너무 스트레스 받지 않기로 했어.",
      "투자는 장기적인 거지 작은 하락에 겁먹는 게 아니잖아.",
      "인내심을 갖고 과정을 믿어야 해, 신경 쓰이긴 하지만.",
      "5년이나 10년 후에 보면 많이 성장해 있고 이런 변동성은 중요하지 않겠지."

      "So today I decided to log into my investment accounts and check how my stocks and funds are performing.",
      "I try not to check too often because it can be stressful, but it'd been a while and I was curious.",
      "When I looked at the numbers, my feelings were honestly pretty mixed about what I saw.",
      "Some of my investments had gone up, which was obviously great and made me feel good.",
      "But then some of them had gone down from when I bought them, which was kinda disappointing.",
      "It's this weird combination of feeling happy and worried at the same time, you know?",
      "Part of me wants to sell the ones that are down before they drop even more.",
      "But then I remember all the advice about not panicking over short-term market swings.",
      "So I made a conscious decision not to stress too much about these day-to-day or week-to-week changes.",
      "Investing is supposed to be a long-term thing, not something where you freak out over every little dip.",
      "I just need to be patient and trust the process, even when it's nerve-wracking.",
      "Hopefully when I look at these same investments in like five or ten years, they'll have grown significantly and all this volatility won't matter."
