      "요즘 댄스 수업을 다니기 시작했다.",
      "처음엔 동작이 어려워서 따라하기 힘들었어.",
      "하지만 계속 연습하니까 조금씩 늘고 있다.",
      "음악에 맞춰 춤추는 게 정말 즐겁다.",
      "선생님이 동작을 보여 줄 때는 엄청 쉽고 부드러워 보였어.",
      "근데 내가 해 보려고 하니까 어? 어떻게 한 거였지? 이랬어.",
      "안무가 생각보다 훨씬 따라 하기 어렵고 계속 스텝을 틀렸어.",
      "다른 사람들이 왼쪽 갈 때 나는 오른쪽 가고 박자도 뒤처지고.",
      "근데 선생님이 진짜 응원해 주시면서 처음엔 다 그렇다고 하셨어.",
      "그래서 답답해도 그냥 계속 반복해서 연습했어.",
      "솔직히 수업 할 때마다 조금씩 나아지는 게 느껴져.",
      "이제 몸이 동작을 자연스럽게 기억하기 시작하는데 그게 진짜 기분 좋아."

      "So I recently started taking dance classes, which is something I've wanted to do for like forever.",
      "I've always loved watching people dance, but I never actually tried it myself until now.",
      "The first few classes were honestly pretty intimidating - everyone seemed so coordinated and I felt kinda awkward.",
      "When the instructor showed us the movements, they looked so easy and smooth when she did them.",
      "But then when it was my turn to try, I was like, wait, how did she do that again?",
      "The choreography was way harder to follow than I expected, and I kept messing up the steps.",
      "I'd be going left when everyone else was going right, or I'd be a beat behind the music.",
      "But the instructor was really encouraging and told me not to worry, that everyone struggles at first.",
      "So I just kept practicing the moves over and over, even when I felt frustrated.",
      "And honestly, I can tell I'm getting better little by little with each class.",
      "My body is starting to remember the movements more naturally now, which feels really good.",
      "There's something so fun and freeing about dancing to music - it's like all my stress just melts away."
