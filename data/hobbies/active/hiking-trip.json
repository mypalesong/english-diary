      "친구들과 함께 근처 산에 등산을 갔다.",
      "올라갈 때는 힘들었지만 정상에서 본 경치가 정말 멋있었어.",
      "맑은 공기를 마시니까 기분이 상쾌했다.",
      "다음에는 더 높은 산에 도전해보고 싶다.",
      "근데 올라갈수록 길이 가팔라지고 훨씬 더 힘들어졌어.",
      "다리는 아프고 숨은 차고, 솔직히 내가 생각한 것보다 체력이 안 좋더라.",
      "중간에 이거 왜 하기로 했지? 이거 고문 아니야? 싶었어.",
      "근데 친구들이 계속 응원해 주고 힘들면 쉬면서 갔어.",
      "2시간쯤 올라가서 정상에 도착했는데 경치가 진짜 미쳤어.",
      "아래 계곡 전체가 보이고 하늘도 엄청 맑고 파랬어.",
      "산 꼭대기에서 신선한 공기를 마시니까 진짜 상쾌하고 살아있는 느낌이었어.",
      "이 경험 덕분에 다음에는 더 높고 어려운 산에 도전해 보고 싶어졌어."

      "So this weekend, a group of my friends and I decided to go hiking on this mountain that's near our town.",
      "We'd been talking about doing it for weeks, and we finally made it happen today.",
      "We started early in the morning to avoid the heat and the crowds, which was a good call.",
      "The trail at the beginning was pretty easy and flat, so we were all chatting and having a good time.",
      "But then as we got higher, the path got steeper and way more challenging.",
      "My legs were burning and I was breathing so hard - honestly, I'm not in as good shape as I thought.",
      "There were moments where I was like, why did I agree to this? This is torture.",
      "But my friends kept encouraging me and we took breaks whenever someone needed to catch their breath.",
      "When we finally reached the summit after like two hours of climbing, the view was absolutely incredible.",
      "You could see the whole valley below us and the sky was so clear and blue.",
      "Breathing in that fresh mountain air made me feel so refreshed and alive, you know?",
      "The whole experience made me want to try an even higher and more challenging mountain next time."
