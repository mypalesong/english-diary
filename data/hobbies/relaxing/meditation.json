      "스트레스가 많아서 요즘 명상을 하고 있다.",
      "조용히 앉아서 호흡에 집중하니까 마음이 차분해졌어.",
      "처음엔 잡념이 많이 들었는데 점점 나아지는 것 같다.",
      "매일 10분씩이라도 하면 도움이 될 것 같다."

      "So I've been dealing with a lot of stress lately - like, way more than usual.",
      "Work has been intense, and I've just been feeling overwhelmed and anxious all the time.",
      "A friend of mine suggested I try meditation, saying it really helped her with stress.",
      "I was kinda skeptical at first because I'm not really into that whole mindfulness thing, you know?",
      "But I figured I'd give it a shot since nothing else was helping.",
      "So I started doing these short meditation sessions, usually in the evening after work.",
      "I just sit down in a quiet spot, close my eyes, and try to focus on my breathing.",
      "Breathing in, breathing out - just paying attention to that simple rhythm.",
      "And honestly, even after just a few minutes, I can feel my mind starting to calm down.",
      "At first though, it was really hard because my mind kept wandering to all my worries and to-do lists.",
      "Like, I'd be trying to focus on breathing, and suddenly I'm thinking about work deadlines or whatever.",
      "But I've noticed it's getting easier the more I practice - I'm getting better at quieting those distracting thoughts and just being present."
