      "주인공의 이야기에 빠져들어서 시간 가는 줄 몰랐다.",
      "독서는 역시 최고의 취미인 것 같다.",
      "이야기가 너무 흥미진진해서 매 챕터마다 계속 읽고 싶게 만들어.",
      "손이 진짜 페이지를 계속 넘기고 있었어.",
      "주인공의 이야기와 그 사람이 겪는 일들에 완전 빠져들었어.",
      "캐릭터한테 뭔가 감정이입이 되고 무슨 일이 일어날지 궁금했어.",
      "가끔 고개를 들면 시간이 흘렀다는 게 놀라웠어.",
      "카페가 더 붐비고 시끄러워졌는데 거의 못 느꼈어.",
      "완전히 내 세계에 빠져서 책 속에 있었어.",
      "독서는 진짜 최고의 취미야, 좋은 이야기에 완전히 빠지는 것만큼 좋은 게 없어."

      "So this afternoon I went to my favorite cafe and just settled in to read for a while.",
      "I've been reading this novel that everyone's been recommending, and honestly it's so good.",
      "I got myself a coffee and found a comfy corner seat by the window.",
      "Then I just opened my book and started reading, and man, I could not put it down.",
      "The story is so engaging - like, every chapter ends with something that makes you wanna keep going.",
      "My hand was literally just turning page after page without stopping.",
      "I was completely absorbed in the protagonist's story and everything they were going through.",
      "Like, I felt so connected to the character and was invested in what happened to them.",
      "I'd look up occasionally and be surprised that time had passed - I'd been reading for hours.",
      "The cafe was getting more crowded and noisier, but I barely even noticed.",
      "I was just totally in my own world, lost in the book.",
      "Reading is honestly the best hobby ever - there's nothing quite like getting completely absorbed in a great story."
