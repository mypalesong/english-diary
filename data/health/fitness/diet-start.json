      "아침은 가볍게 먹고 점심도 샐러드로 먹었어.",
      "저녁쯤 되니까 배가 고파서 힘들었다.",
      "이번엔 꼭 성공하고 싶다.",
      "그래서 점심에 샐러드를 먹었는데 솔직히 별로 만족스럽지 않았어.",
      "샐러드는 괜찮긴 한데 뭔가 배가 제대로 안 차는 느낌이야.",
      "저녁때쯤 되니까 진짜 배가 엄청 고팠어.",
      "배에서 꼬르륵 소리가 계속 나고 먹고 싶은 음식들만 생각났어.",
      "기름지고 맛있는 거 그냥 시켜 먹고 싶은 걸 참는 게 진짜 힘들었어.",
      "그래도 참고 건강한 저녁을 조금만 먹었어.",
      "이번엔 진짜 며칠만 하고 포기하는 게 아니라 꼭 성공하고 싶어.",
      "최선을 다해서 이번엔 진짜 결과를 보고 싶다."

      "So I made a decision today that I'm finally gonna start dieting for real this time.",
      "Like, I've said this before so many times, but honestly, this time I'm serious about it.",
      "I woke up this morning feeling motivated and determined to make a change, you know?",
      "For breakfast, I kept it super light - just some fruit and yogurt instead of my usual heavy meal.",
      "Then for lunch, I had a salad, which honestly wasn't as satisfying as I wanted it to be.",
      "I mean, salads are fine and all, but they don't really fill you up the same way, right?",
      "By the time evening rolled around, I was literally starving.",
      "My stomach was growling like crazy and I kept thinking about all the food I wanted to eat.",
      "It was honestly pretty tough resisting the urge to just order something greasy and delicious.",
      "But I managed to stick with it and ate a small, healthy dinner instead.",
      "I really, really want to succeed with this diet this time - not just give up after a few days.",
      "I'm gonna try my best to stay committed and actually see results for once."
