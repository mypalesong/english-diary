      "체중계에서 내려갔다가 다시 올라가 봤는데 똑같은 숫자가 나왔어.",
      "요즘 운동을 진짜 전혀 안 했거든.",
      "게다가 밤에 야식도 너무 많이 먹었어.",
      "밤에 TV 보다가 갑자기 치킨이나 라면 같은 게 먹고 싶어지는 거야.",
      "그럴 때마다 참지 못하고 그냥 매번 시켜 먹었어.",
      "이 체중 증가는 완전히 내 나쁜 습관 때문이야.",
      "그 순간 바로 내일부터 운동 시작하겠다고 다짐했어."

      "So I stepped on the scale today for the first time in like forever, and honestly, I was totally shocked.",
      "I mean, I knew I'd probably gained some weight, but I wasn't expecting this much.",
      "The number that came up was like 3 kilos higher than it was just last month.",
      "I literally just stood there staring at the scale like, no way, this can't be right.",
      "But I got off and stepped back on again, and yep, same number - it was definitely right.",
      "I know exactly why this happened - I haven't been exercising at all lately.",
      "Plus I've been eating way too many late-night snacks, which is honestly my biggest weakness.",
      "Like, I'll be watching TV at night and suddenly I'm craving fried chicken or ramen or something.",
      "And I just give in every single time instead of having self-control.",
      "This weight gain is completely the result of my bad habits, and I can't even blame anyone else.",
      "I made a promise to myself right then and there that I'm starting to exercise from tomorrow.",
      "No more excuses - I really need to get back in shape before it gets even worse."
