      "So today I finally went to get my flu shot, which I've been putting off for like weeks now.",
      "Every year I tell myself I'm gonna get it early, but then I always end up procrastinating.",
      "This time though, I actually made myself go because flu season is already starting.",
      "I honestly always get a bit nervous before getting shots - I know it's kinda silly, but I just don't like needles.",
      "When it was my turn, the nurse was really quick and efficient about it.",
      "She cleaned my arm, told me to look away, and then boom - it was done in like two seconds.",
      "Honestly, it didn't hurt nearly as much as I thought it would, which was a relief.",
      "Like, I'd been building it up in my head as this big painful thing, but it was actually pretty mild.",
      "Right after the vaccination though, my arm started feeling kinda heavy and a bit sore.",
      "It's this weird sensation, like someone punched my arm but not super hard, you know?",
      "I'm pretty sure my arm is gonna be more sore tomorrow - that's usually how it goes with flu shots.",
      "But even though I know it'll hurt for a day or two, I'm really glad I got it done - better safe than sorry."
