      "독감 예방접종을 맞으러 갔다.",
      "주사 맞을 때 생각보다 안 아팠어.",
      "접종 후에 팔이 좀 묵직한 느낌이 든다.",
      "내일은 팔이 좀 아프겠지만 그래도 맞길 잘했다.",
      "내 차례가 됐을 때 간호사가 진짜 빠르고 효율적으로 해 주셨어.",
      "팔을 소독하고 다른 데 보라고 하시더니 바로 끝났어.",
      "솔직히 생각했던 것보다 훨씬 안 아파서 안심됐어.",
      "머릿속으로 엄청 아플 거라고 생각했는데 실제로는 별로 안 아팠어.",
      "그런데 접종 바로 후에 팔이 좀 무겁고 약간 아픈 느낌이 들더라.",
      "누가 팔을 세게는 아니고 그냥 쳤을 때 같은 그런 느낌?",
      "내일은 팔이 더 아플 거야, 독감 주사는 보통 그렇거든.",
      "하루 이틀 좀 아프겠지만 그래도 맞길 잘한 것 같아."

      "So today I finally went to get my flu shot, which I've been putting off for like weeks now.",
      "Every year I tell myself I'm gonna get it early, but then I always end up procrastinating.",
      "This time though, I actually made myself go because flu season is already starting.",
      "I honestly always get a bit nervous before getting shots - I know it's kinda silly, but I just don't like needles.",
      "When it was my turn, the nurse was really quick and efficient about it.",
      "She cleaned my arm, told me to look away, and then boom - it was done in like two seconds.",
      "Honestly, it didn't hurt nearly as much as I thought it would, which was a relief.",
      "Like, I'd been building it up in my head as this big painful thing, but it was actually pretty mild.",
      "Right after the vaccination though, my arm started feeling kinda heavy and a bit sore.",
      "It's this weird sensation, like someone punched my arm but not super hard, you know?",
      "I'm pretty sure my arm is gonna be more sore tomorrow - that's usually how it goes with flu shots.",
      "But even though I know it'll hurt for a day or two, I'm really glad I got it done - better safe than sorry."
