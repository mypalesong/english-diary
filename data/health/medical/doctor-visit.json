      "So my throat has been hurting for like several days now and it wasn't getting any better.",
      "I kept thinking it would just go away on its own, you know, like it usually does.",
      "But this morning I woke up and it was even worse, so I was like, okay, I need to see a doctor.",
      "I called the clinic and made an appointment for this afternoon.",
      "When I got there, the waiting room was absolutely packed with people.",
      "I checked in and then just sat there waiting for my name to be called.",
      "Honestly, I waited for over an hour, which was super annoying and boring.",
      "I was just scrolling through my phone the whole time trying to pass the time.",
      "When I finally got in to see the doctor, the actual consultation was literally like 5 minutes.",
      "She looked at my throat, asked a few questions, and then wrote me a prescription.",
      "I was kinda like, that's it? I waited an hour for this 5-minute checkup?",
      "Anyway, I got the medicine from the pharmacy and came home - now I just need to take it and rest up."
