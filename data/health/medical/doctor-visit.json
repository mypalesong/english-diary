      "며칠째 목이 아파서 병원에 갔다.",
      "대기실에서 한 시간 넘게 기다렸어.",
      "진료는 5분 만에 끝나고 약을 처방받았다.",
      "집에 와서 약 먹고 푹 쉬어야겠다.",
      "병원에 도착했을 때 대기실에 사람들이 진짜 많았어.",
      "체크인하고 나서 내 이름이 불릴 때까지 그냥 앉아서 기다렸어.",
      "솔직히 한 시간 넘게 기다렸는데 진짜 짜증 나고 지루했어.",
      "그냥 계속 핸드폰 보면서 시간 때우고 있었어.",
      "드디어 진료실에 들어갔을 때 실제 진료는 진짜 5분 정도밖에 안 걸렸어.",
      "선생님이 목을 보시고 몇 가지 질문하시더니 처방전을 써 주셨어.",
      "한 시간 기다려서 5분 진료받았다고? 이런 생각이 들더라.",
      "어쨌든 약국에서 약 받아서 집에 왔으니까 이제 약 먹고 푹 쉬어야겠어."

      "So my throat has been hurting for like several days now and it wasn't getting any better.",
      "I kept thinking it would just go away on its own, you know, like it usually does.",
      "But this morning I woke up and it was even worse, so I was like, okay, I need to see a doctor.",
      "I called the clinic and made an appointment for this afternoon.",
      "When I got there, the waiting room was absolutely packed with people.",
      "I checked in and then just sat there waiting for my name to be called.",
      "Honestly, I waited for over an hour, which was super annoying and boring.",
      "I was just scrolling through my phone the whole time trying to pass the time.",
      "When I finally got in to see the doctor, the actual consultation was literally like 5 minutes.",
      "She looked at my throat, asked a few questions, and then wrote me a prescription.",
      "I was kinda like, that's it? I waited an hour for this 5-minute checkup?",
      "Anyway, I got the medicine from the pharmacy and came home - now I just need to take it and rest up."
