      "오늘은 1년에 한 번 하는 건강검진 날이다.",
      "아침부터 금식해서 배가 너무 고팠어.",
      "이것저것 검사하느라 3시간이나 걸렸다.",
      "결과가 나오면 좀 걱정되는데 건강했으면 좋겠다.",
      "간호사가 검사 다 끝날 때까지 아무것도 먹으면 안 된다고 해서 더 힘들었어.",
      "혈액 검사, 소변 검사, X-레이 같은 거 이것저것 다 했어.",
      "3시간 동안 계속 이 방 저 방 돌아다니면서 검사만 했어.",
      "어떤 검사는 빨리 끝났는데 어떤 건 진짜 오래 걸려서 줄 서서 기다려야 했어.",
      "그 시간 내내 검사 끝나면 뭐 먹을까만 생각했어.",
      "다 끝나고 나니까 결과는 일주일 정도 후에 나온대.",
      "이제 솔직히 결과가 좀 걱정되긴 해.",
      "요즘 건강 관리를 잘 못했거든, 그래서 뭔가 나올까 봐 좀 불안해."

      "So today was the day for my annual health checkup that I do once a year.",
      "I had to fast from the night before, which meant no breakfast this morning at all.",
      "By the time I got to the hospital, I was literally starving - my stomach was growling so loud.",
      "The nurse told me I couldn't eat anything until all the tests were done, which made it even worse.",
      "They had me do all these different tests - blood work, urine sample, X-rays, the whole thing.",
      "I was going from one room to another for like three hours straight, just doing test after test.",
      "Some of the tests were quick, but some of them took forever and I had to wait in line.",
      "The whole time I was just thinking about what I was gonna eat as soon as this was over.",
      "When I finally finished everything, they said the results would come out in about a week.",
      "Now I'm honestly a bit nervous about what the results will show.",
      "Like, I know I haven't been taking the best care of myself lately, so I'm kinda worried.",
      "I really hope everything comes back normal and healthy - fingers crossed I guess."
