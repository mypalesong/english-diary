      "두통약이 떨어져서 퇴근길에 약국에 들렀다.",
      "약사님이 친절하게 증상을 물어보시더라.",
      "추천해주신 약이랑 비타민도 같이 샀어.",
      "건강 관리를 좀 더 신경 써야 할 것 같다.",
      "약사님이 두통이 얼마나 자주 오는지 얼마나 심한지 물어보시더라.",
      "일주일에 몇 번씩 오는데 보통 퇴근할 때쯤 생긴다고 설명했어.",
      "약사님이 긴장성 두통에 효과 좋은 특정 브랜드를 추천해 주셨어.",
      "거기 있는 김에 건강을 위해 비타민도 먹어 보는 게 어떻겠냐고 제안하시더라.",
      "그래서 뭐 그럼 그렇게 하자 싶어서 두통약이랑 종합 비타민을 같이 샀어.",
      "이 경험 때문에 내가 요즘 건강을 좀 소홀히 했구나 싶었어.",
      "증상만 치료할 게 아니라 더 적극적으로 건강 관리를 해야 할 것 같아.",
      "진짜 건강 관리에 더 신경 쓰고 병원도 가 봐야겠어."

      "So I realized this afternoon that I completely ran out of headache medicine, which is like my go-to thing.",
      "I've been getting these headaches pretty regularly lately, probably from staring at screens all day.",
      "On my way home from work today, I decided to stop by the pharmacy to pick up some more.",
      "When I got there, the pharmacist was super nice and asked me about my symptoms.",
      "She wanted to know how often I was getting these headaches and how severe they were.",
      "I explained that it's been happening like a few times a week, usually by the end of the workday.",
      "She recommended this specific brand that she said was pretty effective for tension headaches.",
      "While I was there, she also suggested I might wanna try taking some vitamins for overall health.",
      "I figured, why not, you know? So I ended up buying both the headache medicine and a bottle of multivitamins.",
      "The whole experience made me realize I've been kind of neglecting my health lately.",
      "Like, I should probably be more proactive about taking care of myself instead of just treating symptoms.",
      "I think I really need to start paying more attention to my health management and maybe even see a doctor soon."
