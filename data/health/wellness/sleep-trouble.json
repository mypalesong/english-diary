      "Lately I've been having such terrible sleep, like I just can't seem to get a proper night's rest.",
      "It's been going on for like a week or two now, and honestly it's really affecting me.",
      "I'm literally exhausted all day long - from the moment I wake up until I go to bed.",
      "The weird thing is, when I actually lie down in bed at night, I just can't fall asleep.",
      "My mind is racing with all these random thoughts, or sometimes it's just like... nothing, but I still can't sleep.",
      "So what ends up happening is I just grab my phone and start scrolling through social media.",
      "I know that's probably making it worse because of the blue light and all that, but I can't help it.",
      "I'll be lying there for hours just looking at Instagram or YouTube or whatever, waiting to feel tired.",
      "I've been thinking about why this is happening, and I think maybe I've been drinking way too much coffee.",
      "Like, I had three cups today alone, and the last one was pretty late in the afternoon.",
      "That's probably keeping me wired and making it impossible to wind down at night.",
      "I made a promise to myself today that I'm gonna go to bed early tonight and actually try to fix this sleep schedule."
