      "꾸준히 먹는 게 중요하다는데 잊지 말아야지.",
      "매일 아침 먹는 걸 잊지 않으려고 비타민 병을 책상 위에 두었어.",
      "그러면 앉자마자 바로 보이니까 잊어버릴 핑계가 없거든.",
      "지금까지는 꽤 잘하고 있어, 하루도 빠뜨리지 않았어.",
      "근데 솔직히 이게 실제로 효과가 있는지는 잘 모르겠어.",
      "뭔가 확 에너지가 넘친다거나 그런 건 없거든.",
      "그래도 건강 관리를 하려고 노력한다는 마음의 평화는 있어.",
      "다들 비타민은 꾸준히 먹어야 효과가 있대.",
      "그래서 최소 몇 달은 계속 먹어서 효과가 있는지 보려고."

      "So I've been feeling super tired and run down lately, like constantly exhausted no matter how much I sleep.",
      "I was talking to a friend about it, and she suggested that maybe I should try taking multivitamins.",
      "I figured it couldn't hurt, you know? So I went out and bought a bottle of those daily multivitamins.",
      "I started taking them a few days ago, trying to make it a regular habit.",
      "To help me remember to actually take them every single morning, I put the bottle right on my desk.",
      "That way it's literally the first thing I see when I sit down, so there's no excuse to forget.",
      "I've been pretty good about it so far - haven't missed a day yet, which is kinda surprising for me.",
      "Honestly though, I'm not really sure if they're actually working or making any difference.",
      "Like, I don't feel dramatically more energetic or anything like that.",
      "But at the same time, it does give me this peace of mind, knowing I'm at least trying to take care of my health.",
      "Everyone always says that the key with vitamins is consistency - you have to take them regularly for them to help.",
      "So I'm gonna try my best not to forget and keep up this routine for at least a few months to see if it helps."
