      "하루 종일 모니터를 보다 보니 눈이 너무 아프다.",
      "눈이 빨갛게 충혈되고 뻑뻑한 느낌이 들어.",
      "인공눈물을 넣고 눈 마사지를 했다.",
      "블루라이트 차단 안경을 사야 할 것 같다.",
      "거울을 봤더니 눈이 완전 빨갛게 충혈돼 있더라.",
      "눈도 엄청 건조하고 뭔가 모래 같은 게 들어간 것처럼 뻑뻑했어.",
      "눈 깜빡일 때 부드럽지 않고 뭔가 걸리는 느낌?",
      "뭔가 해야겠다 싶어서 책상 서랍에서 인공눈물을 꺼냈어.",
      "양쪽 눈에 몇 방울씩 넣었더니 건조한 건 좀 나아졌어.",
      "그 다음에 인터넷에서 배운 눈 마사지를 해 봤어.",
      "눈 주변을 살살 눌러 주니까 좀 시원하고 일시적으로 편해지더라.",
      "근데 솔직히 블루라이트 차단 안경을 진짜 사야 할 것 같아."

      "So by the end of today, my eyes were literally killing me - like, seriously painful.",
      "I've been staring at my computer monitor pretty much nonstop since this morning for work.",
      "Like, I had so many tasks to finish that I barely even took breaks, which I know isn't good.",
      "Every time I tried to focus on the screen, my eyes would just start hurting more and more.",
      "When I finally looked in the mirror, I could see my eyes were all bloodshot and red.",
      "They also felt super dry and kind of gritty, like there was sand in them or something.",
      "That feeling when you blink and it's not smooth? Yeah, that's what I was dealing with all afternoon.",
      "I realized I needed to do something about it, so I grabbed my artificial tears from my desk drawer.",
      "I put a few drops in each eye, which helped a little bit with the dryness at least.",
      "Then I tried doing this eye massage thing I learned online - just gently pressing around the eye area.",
      "It felt kinda good and gave me some temporary relief from the strain.",
      "But honestly, I think I seriously need to invest in some blue light blocking glasses or something, because this can't keep happening every day."
