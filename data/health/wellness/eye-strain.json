      "So by the end of today, my eyes were literally killing me - like, seriously painful.",
      "I've been staring at my computer monitor pretty much nonstop since this morning for work.",
      "Like, I had so many tasks to finish that I barely even took breaks, which I know isn't good.",
      "Every time I tried to focus on the screen, my eyes would just start hurting more and more.",
      "When I finally looked in the mirror, I could see my eyes were all bloodshot and red.",
      "They also felt super dry and kind of gritty, like there was sand in them or something.",
      "That feeling when you blink and it's not smooth? Yeah, that's what I was dealing with all afternoon.",
      "I realized I needed to do something about it, so I grabbed my artificial tears from my desk drawer.",
      "I put a few drops in each eye, which helped a little bit with the dryness at least.",
      "Then I tried doing this eye massage thing I learned online - just gently pressing around the eye area.",
      "It felt kinda good and gave me some temporary relief from the strain.",
      "But honestly, I think I seriously need to invest in some blue light blocking glasses or something, because this can't keep happening every day."
