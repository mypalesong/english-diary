      "So right after I finished lunch, it suddenly started raining out of nowhere.",
      "Like, the sky had been kinda cloudy all morning, but I didn't think it was actually gonna rain.",
      "But then all of a sudden I heard these raindrops hitting the window, you know?",
      "I was like, oh perfect, this is actually really nice.",
      "I grabbed myself a cup of coffee and found this spot by the window.",
      "Just sat there with my coffee, not doing anything else, just listening to the rain.",
      "Honestly, there's something really soothing about rain sounds, don't you think?",
      "It's like this constant pitter-patter rhythm that's super calming.",
      "I wasn't checking my phone or anything, just kind of zoning out and watching the rain fall.",
      "My mind just felt really clear and quiet for once, which is pretty rare these days.",
      "It's weird how something as simple as rain can make you feel so peaceful.",
      "I sat there for like 20 minutes just enjoying that moment, and honestly it felt really good."
