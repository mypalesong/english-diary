      "매장마다 줄을 서야 해서 제대로 구경도 못했어.",
      "옷 가게 피팅룸도 웨이팅이 엄청나더라.",
      "결국 몇 개 둘러보다가 그냥 나왔어.",
      "음식점도 전부 대기 시간이 1시간 이상이었어.",
      "푸드코트에서 간단하게 먹고 나왔지.",
      "주차장 빠져나오는 것도 30분이나 걸렸다.",
      "차들이 막혀서 진짜 답답했어.",
      "이렇게 붐비는 쇼핑몰은 처음이었어.",
      "다음엔 평일에 가야겠다.",
      "아니면 온라인으로 사는 게 나을 것 같아.",
      "주말에 쇼핑몰 가는 건 정말 실수였어."

      "I went to the mall on the weekend and it was, like, really crowded.",
      "Even parking was difficult from the start.",
      "I drove around for about 30 minutes before I finally found a spot.",
      "I couldn't even look around properly because there were lines at every store.",
      "The fitting rooms at clothing stores also had crazy waiting times.",
      "Eventually I just looked at a few things and then left.",
      "All the restaurants had wait times of over an hour too.",
      "I just ate something quick at the food court and left.",
      "It took 30 minutes just to get out of the parking lot.",
      "The cars were backed up, so it was honestly really frustrating.",
      "This was the first time I've seen a mall this crowded.",
      "Next time, I should definitely go on a weekday.",
      "Or maybe it's better to just shop online.",
      "Going to the mall on a weekend was really a mistake."
