      "주문한 옷이 생각했던 거랑 완전 달라서 반품하기로 했다.",
      "사진이랑 실물이 너무 차이 나서 실망스러웠어.",
      "색깔도 다르고 재질도 싸 보였어.",
      "게다가 사이즈도 표기된 것보다 작더라고.",
      "입어보니까 맞지 않아서 바로 벗었지.",
      "반품 신청하고 편의점에 맡기는 것도 일이네.",
      "박스도 다시 포장해야 하고 테이프도 붙여야 하고 번거로워.",
      "편의점 가서 택배 접수하는 것도 귀찮아.",
      "반품 비용은 무료라서 다행이야.",
      "구매자 책임이었으면 돈 날렸을 뻔했어.",
      "다음엔 후기를 더 꼼꼼히 봐야겠다.",
      "특히 포토리뷰를 많이 참고해야 할 것 같아.",
      "환불은 3일 정도 걸린다고 하네.",
      "앞으로는 온라인 쇼핑 신중하게 해야겠어."

      "The clothes I ordered were completely different from what I expected, so I decided to return them.",
      "I was disappointed because, like, the photos and the actual product were so different.",
      "The color was different and the material looked cheap.",
      "Plus, the size was actually smaller than what was indicated.",
      "When I tried it on, it didn't fit, so I took it right off.",
      "Even requesting a return and dropping it off at the convenience store is a hassle.",
      "I have to repack the box and tape it up, which is annoying.",
      "Going to the convenience store to process the delivery is also bothersome.",
      "Luckily, the return shipping is free.",
      "If it had been the buyer's responsibility, I would've wasted money.",
      "Next time, I should read reviews more carefully.",
      "Especially, I think I need to refer to photo reviews a lot.",
      "They said the refund will take about 3 days.",
      "From now on, I should be more careful with online shopping."
