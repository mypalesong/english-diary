      "10년 만에 고등학교 동창회가 열렸다.",
      "30명 정도 모였는데 다 오랜만에 보는 얼굴들이야.",
      "다들 많이 변해서 처음엔 어색했어.",
      "누군지 못 알아보는 친구들도 있었어.",
      "하지만 이야기하다 보니 옛날 생각이 나면서 편해졌다.",
      "고등학교 때 있었던 재밌는 에피소드들을 얘기하면서 웃었어.",
      "선생님 흉내 내던 친구도 있고 정말 웃겼어.",
      "시간이 이렇게 빨리 흘렀다는 게 실감 났다.",
      "어떤 친구는 벌써 결혼해서 애도 있더라고.",
      "나는 아직 싱글이라 좀 쓸쓸했어.",
      "하지만 친구들 만나서 즐거웠어.",
      "다들 각자의 삶을 열심히 살고 있는 것 같아.",
      "다음엔 5년 후에 다시 만나기로 했어.",
      "그때는 나도 좀 더 성장해 있을까."

      "A high school reunion was held after 10 years.",
      "About 30 people gathered, and they were all faces I haven't seen in a long time.",
      "Everyone had changed so much that it was awkward at first.",
      "There were some friends I couldn't even recognize.",
      "But as we talked, old memories came back and it became comfortable.",
      "We laughed while talking about funny episodes from high school.",
      "There was a friend who imitated our teacher, and it was really funny.",
      "I realized how quickly time had passed.",
      "Some friends were already married and even had kids.",
      "I'm still single, so I felt a bit lonely.",
      "But I had fun meeting my friends.",
      "It seems like everyone is living their own lives diligently.",
      "We decided to meet again in 5 years.",
      "I wonder if I'll have grown more by then."
