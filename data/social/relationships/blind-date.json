      "카페에서 만나기로 했는데 먼저 도착해서 기다렸어.",
      "처음엔 긴장돼서 말을 잘 못했어.",
      "뭐라고 말해야 할지 몰라서 어색했어.",
      "그래도 상대방이 잘 맞춰줘서 편하게 이야기했다.",
      "공통 관심사도 있어서 대화가 잘 통했어.",
      "영화 얘기랑 여행 얘기를 주로 했어.",
      "시간이 금방 지나가서 깜짝 놀랐어.",
      "상대방 인상도 좋고 매너도 좋았어.",
      "다음에 또 만날지는 좀 더 생각해봐야겠다.",
      "좋긴 한데 확신이 서지는 않아.",
      "친구한테 어땠는지 물어보더라고 솔직하게 말했어.",
      "일단 천천히 알아가면서 결정하려고.",
      "소개팅이 생각보다 나쁘지 않았어."

      "We agreed to meet at a cafe, and I arrived first and waited.",
      "I was nervous at first and couldn't speak well.",
      "It was awkward because I didn't know what to say.",
      "But they accommodated me well, so we had a comfortable conversation.",
      "We had common interests, so the conversation flowed well.",
      "We mainly talked about movies and travel.",
      "I was surprised at how quickly time passed.",
      "They had a good impression and good manners too.",
      "I need to think more about whether to meet again next time.",
      "They're nice, but I'm not totally sure.",
      "My friend asked how it went, and I told them honestly.",
      "For now, I'm going to get to know them slowly and then decide.",
      "The blind date wasn't as bad as I thought it would be."
