      "그냥 갑자기 쏟아지더라고, 1분 전까지 맑았는데.",
      "오후엔 특별히 할 일이 없었어.",
      "그래서 커피 한 잔 타서 쉬기로 했어.",
      "창가에 비 오는 거 볼 수 있는 자리 찾아서 앉았어.",
      "안에서 따뜻하게 있으면서 밖에 비 오는 거 보면 진짜 좋잖아.",
      "그냥 거기 앉아서 커피 마시면서 아무것도 안 했어.",
      "핸드폰도 안 보고 그냥 빗소리만 들었어.",
      "빗소리에는 리듬감이 있어서 진짜 진정되더라고.",
      "머릿속이 텅 비워지면서 일이나 스트레스 생각 안 나고.",
      "그냥 현재 순간에 집중하게 되더라, 평소엔 잘 안 그러는데.",
      "마음이 묘하게 편안해졌다."

      "So right after I finished eating lunch today, it suddenly started raining outside.",
      "Like, it came out of nowhere - one minute it was dry, and the next minute rain was just pouring down.",
      "I wasn't really planning to do anything in particular this afternoon anyway.",
      "So I decided to just grab a cup of coffee and take a little break.",
      "I found a spot by the window where I could see the rain falling and just settled in there.",
      "There's something really nice about watching rain from inside when you're all warm and cozy, you know?",
      "I sat there with my coffee, not doing anything productive, not checking my phone - just existing.",
      "Just listening to the sound of the raindrops hitting the window and the roof.",
      "There's this rhythmic quality to rain sounds that's honestly really soothing and calming.",
      "My mind kind of zoned out and I wasn't thinking about work or stress or anything.",
      "I was just in this state of being present in the moment, which doesn't happen often for me.",
      "The whole experience left me feeling oddly peaceful and content - like my mind had been given this little rest it needed."
