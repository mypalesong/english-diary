      "온라인으로 주문한 책장이 도착해서 조립했다.",
      "설명서를 보면서 했는데 생각보다 복잡했어.",
      "나사를 조이고 판을 끼우는 데 두 시간이 걸렸다.",
      "완성하고 나니까 뿌듯하고 방이 더 정리된 느낌이다.",
      "설명서를 꺼내서 한 단계씩 읽으면서 시작했어.",
      "다이어그램이 도움이 되긴 했는데 솔직히 좀 헷갈렸어.",
      "제대로 하고 있는지 확신이 안 서서 계속 다시 읽었어.",
      "그 작은 공구로 작은 나사들을 다 조이는 게 엄청 오래 걸렸어.",
      "판들을 끼우는 것도 보기보다 훨씬 어려웠어.",
      "전체 조립 과정이 2시간이나 걸렸는데 생각보다 훨씬 오래 걸렸어.",
      "근데 마지막 나사를 조이고 뒤로 물러나서 보니까 진짜 뿌듯했어.",
      "이제 방이 훨씬 더 정리된 느낌이고 책들을 제대로 정리할 수 있어."

      "So the bookshelf I ordered online finally arrived today in this huge flat box.",
      "I was actually pretty excited to get it because I've been needing more storage space for my books.",
      "When I opened the box, there were like a million pieces and parts scattered everywhere.",
      "Panels, screws, dowels, brackets - I was honestly a bit intimidated by the whole thing.",
      "I pulled out the instruction manual and started reading through it step by step.",
      "The manual had these diagrams that were supposed to be helpful, but honestly they were kinda confusing.",
      "I kept having to go back and reread the steps because I wasn't sure if I was doing it right.",
      "Tightening all those tiny screws with the little tool they provided took forever.",
      "And fitting the panels together was way harder than it looked - some of them didn't want to go in smoothly.",
      "The whole assembly process ended up taking me like two full hours, which was way longer than I expected.",
      "But when I finally tightened the last screw and stepped back to look at it, I felt really proud.",
      "My room looks so much more organized now with the new bookshelf, and I can finally put all my books away properly."
