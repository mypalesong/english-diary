      "식기세척기가 정말 필요한 것 같다.",
      "그릇, 접시, 냄비, 프라이팬까지 지난 며칠 동안 쌓인 게 엄청났어.",
      "나중에 하겠다고 계속 미루고 또 미뤘어.",
      "저녁 만들어 먹으면서 계속 저 설거지가 날 기다리고 있다고 생각했어.",
      "저녁 먹고 나니까 방금 쓴 그릇까지 더해져서 더 많아졌어.",
      "더 이상 미룰 수 없어서 결국 한꺼번에 다 했어.",
      "30분 동안 싱크대 앞에 서서 다 닦았는데 진짜 재미없었어.",
      "손은 물에 불어서 쭈글쭈글해지고 세제 때문에 건조해졌어.",
      "하는 내내 식기세척기 진짜 사야겠다고 생각했어."

      "So here's the thing - I actually enjoy cooking, but washing dishes afterwards is honestly the worst part.",
      "Like, I love making food and trying new recipes, but the cleanup? Ugh, I hate it so much.",
      "Today when I got home from work, I looked at my sink and there were dishes piled up everywhere.",
      "Bowls, plates, pots, pans - just a huge mess from the past few days.",
      "I kept telling myself I'd do them later, you know, just putting it off again and again.",
      "So I made dinner and ate, and the whole time I was thinking about those dishes waiting for me.",
      "After dinner, the pile had gotten even bigger with the new dishes I just used.",
      "I finally forced myself to just do it all at once instead of procrastinating any longer.",
      "I stood at the sink for like thirty minutes scrubbing everything, which was not fun.",
      "My hands got all pruney from the water and the soap made them feel dry.",
      "The whole time I was doing it, I was thinking about how I seriously need to get a dishwasher.",
      "Like, that would be such a game changer - just load it up and press a button, done."
