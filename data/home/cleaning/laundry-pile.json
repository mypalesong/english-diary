      "So this weekend I finally dealt with the massive pile of laundry that had been building up all week.",
      "Like, I'd been ignoring it for days and just wearing whatever clean clothes I had left.",
      "But I was literally running out of things to wear, so I couldn't put it off any longer.",
      "I gathered up all the dirty clothes from my hamper and around my room.",
      "The pile was honestly huge - way bigger than I thought it would be.",
      "I had to run the washing machine three separate times to get through everything.",
      "Each load took like an hour, so I was basically doing laundry all afternoon.",
      "And washing was just the first part - then I had to hang everything up to dry.",
      "Hanging up all those clothes took forever, and my arms were getting tired from reaching up.",
      "After they dried, I still had to fold everything and put it all away neatly.",
      "That part is honestly just as much work as the actual washing, if not more.",
      "But at least now I have plenty of clean clothes to wear for the next week or two, which is a relief."
