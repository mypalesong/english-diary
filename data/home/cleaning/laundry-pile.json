      "주말 동안 밀린 빨래를 몰아서 했어.",
      "며칠 동안 계속 미뤄왔는데, 입을 옷이 진짜 얼마 안 남았어.",
      "더 이상 미룰 수가 없어서 결국 해야 했어.",
      "빨래 바구니랑 방 여기저기서 더러운 옷들을 다 모았어.",
      "더미가 진짜 컸어, 생각했던 것보다 훨씬 많았어.",
      "세탁기를 세 번이나 돌려야 했어.",
      "한 번에 한 시간씩 걸려서 오후 내내 빨래만 했어.",
      "세탁은 첫 단계일 뿐이야, 그 다음엔 다 널어야 했어.",
      "옷 전부 거는 데 엄청 오래 걸렸고 팔이 계속 올리느라 피곤했어.",
      "다 마르고 나서도 아직 개서 정리해야 했어.",
      "그 부분이 진짜 빨래하는 것만큼 힘든 일이야.",
      "근데 이제 앞으로 한두 주 입을 깨끗한 옷이 많아서 다행이야."

      "So this weekend I finally dealt with the massive pile of laundry that had been building up all week.",
      "Like, I'd been ignoring it for days and just wearing whatever clean clothes I had left.",
      "But I was literally running out of things to wear, so I couldn't put it off any longer.",
      "I gathered up all the dirty clothes from my hamper and around my room.",
      "The pile was honestly huge - way bigger than I thought it would be.",
      "I had to run the washing machine three separate times to get through everything.",
      "Each load took like an hour, so I was basically doing laundry all afternoon.",
      "And washing was just the first part - then I had to hang everything up to dry.",
      "Hanging up all those clothes took forever, and my arms were getting tired from reaching up.",
      "After they dried, I still had to fold everything and put it all away neatly.",
      "That part is honestly just as much work as the actual washing, if not more.",
      "But at least now I have plenty of clean clothes to wear for the next week or two, which is a relief."
