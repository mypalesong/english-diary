      "So today I was trying to clean my apartment, and suddenly my vacuum cleaner just stopped working.",
      "Like, I turned it on and it made this weird noise, and then nothing - it was completely dead.",
      "I was honestly pretty flustered because I really needed to vacuum, and now I couldn't.",
      "I tried all sorts of things to fix it - unplugging it, checking if something was stuck, pressing different buttons.",
      "I even looked at the manual to see if there was some reset button or something I was missing.",
      "But no matter what I did, the vacuum just wouldn't turn back on - it was totally useless.",
      "So I gave up on fixing it myself and called the service center to explain the problem.",
      "They said they'd send a repair technician out to take a look at it sometime this week.",
      "The person on the phone couldn't tell me what was wrong or give me an estimate over the phone.",
      "Now I'm just sitting here worried about how much this repair is gonna cost me.",
      "Like, if it's something expensive, I might as well just buy a new vacuum instead, you know?",
      "I really hope it's just something simple and cheap to fix, but I'm not feeling super optimistic about it."
