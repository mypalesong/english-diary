      "20분 동안 뚫어뻥질 했는데 뭐가 막혔든 뚫으려고 했어.",
      "근데 아무리 해도 물이 안 내려갔어, 진짜 짜증 났어.",
      "배수구 세정제도 부어 봤는데 그것도 소용없더라고.",
      "그때 혼자는 못 하겠다 전문가가 필요하다고 생각했어.",
      "인터넷으로 배관 업체를 찾아서 전화해서 상황을 설명했어.",
      "당일에 사람을 보내 줬는데 다행이고 배관공이 꽤 빨리 고쳤어.",
      "파이프에 꽤 심한 막힘이 생겼는데 그걸 뚫었대.",
      "배관공이 여기가 오래된 건물이라 이런 배관 문제가 더 자주 생긴대."

      "So today I noticed that the water in my kitchen sink wasn't draining properly at all.",
      "Like, I'd turn on the faucet and the water would just sit there in the basin, barely going down.",
      "It was super gross because all the food particles and stuff were just floating there.",
      "I figured the drain must be clogged with something, so I grabbed my plunger to try and fix it.",
      "I spent like twenty minutes plunging away, trying to create suction and unclog whatever was stuck.",
      "But no matter how hard I tried, the water still wouldn't drain - it was so frustrating.",
      "I even tried pouring some drain cleaner down there, but that didn't help either.",
      "At that point I was like, okay, I can't handle this myself, I need professional help.",
      "So I looked up a plumbing company online and gave them a call to explain the situation.",
      "They sent someone out the same day, which was good, and the plumber fixed it pretty quickly.",
      "He said there was a pretty nasty clog built up in the pipes, which he cleared out.",
      "The plumber also mentioned that since my place is in an older building, these kinds of plumbing issues tend to happen more frequently."
